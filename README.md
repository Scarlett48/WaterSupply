The User can create a new account for him or use an existing account to avail all the services provided by the system. The User can request for two different services: “Request for reused water / harvested water”. Reused water is provided under two different qualities, Grade A and Grade B. Grade A can be used for gardening, air coolers, etc. Grade B can be used for toilet flushing, etc. We also provide harvested water from our harvesting pits if the user requests for it; “Supply used water”. The User can request for providing the water that has been used in their household. It will be treated and provided back to the customer if he requests for it or else will be stored in our plant.
